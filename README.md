A Minecraft plugin to track the contents (items and their positions) of container inventories. 
It will also track [physical actions](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/event/block/Action.html).

## Prerequisites

## Building
Compile a `.jar` from the commandline by doing an `install` via Maven:
```
$ mvn install
```
It should show up in the `target` directory. Make sure to update the version number.
